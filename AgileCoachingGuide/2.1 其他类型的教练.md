## 2.1 Other kinds of coaching
2.1 其他类型的教练

In this chapter we would like to position agile coaching by comparing it to two other well-known coaching domains: **systemic coaching** and **sports coaching**.
在本章里，我们希望将敏捷教练与其他两个著名的教练领域进行比较：系统教练和体育教练。

If you haven’t heard about systemic coaching before, you can think of it as the classical therapy or counseling approach. Imagine a patient sitting in a comfortable lounger and a calm, neutrally dressed counselor in a hardback chair with a notepad in her hand, asking “And how can I help you today?”
如果你之前没有听说过系统教练，你可以把它看作是古典疗法或咨询方法。 想象一下，一个病人坐在舒适的躺椅上，一个冷静的穿着中性的顾问坐在一张精装的椅子上，手里拿着一个记事本，问道：“今天我该怎么帮你呢？

A systemic coach works with the system. The information, interpre- tations, goals and actions all come from the coachee and the systemic coach merely facilitates discovery through discussion. She asks neutral, open-ended questions related to keywords that pop up in the discus- sion. For example “Tell me more about your time there?” or “How did the others react to this piece of news?”
系统教练与系统一起工作。 信息，诠释，目标和行动都来自被指导（咨询）的人们，系统教练仅仅是通过讨论来促进一些发现。 她会问一些与讨论中出现的关键词有关的，中立的开放性问题。 例如“告诉我多一点你在那时那地发生的事情？”或者“其他人如何回应这条消息？

Agile coaching borrows a lot from systemic coaching. However, where the systemic coach is non-directing, the agile coach usually has an agenda of making the team more agile. Both systemic coaches and agile coaches usually have a sponsor and have been hired to achieve a goal. The difference is that systemic coaches try not to impose their own thoughts and ideas in the discussions. For an agile coach, part of the goal is to act as a role model, infusing the organization with agile thinking and practices.
敏捷教练从系统教练领域借鉴了很多。 然而，在系统教练不适用的场景下，敏捷教练通常有一个议程，可以让团队更加敏捷。 系统教练和敏捷教练通常是被一个发起人聘用来实现一个目标。 不同之处在于，系统教练不需要在讨论中强加自己的观点和想法。 对于敏捷教练来说，目标的一部分就是充当榜样，为组织注入灵活的思维和实践。


Sports Coach | Agile Coach | Systemic Coach
---|---|---
Sets goals and targets for the team | Supports the team, provides benchmarks | Accepts any result
Defines the team | May discuss roles with manager | Accepts the team as it is
Lays off non-performing team members | Helps team members find ways to improve | Helps team members find ways to improve
Tells the team what to do in a given situation | Outside the selected method, helps the team understand the approach in a given situation | Helps the team explore scenarios and choose which one to pursue
Has a somewhat linear understanding of cause and effect | Uses lean and agile thinking to understand cause and effects | Has a circular understanding of cause and effect
Very transparent emotions | Moderate display of emotions | Aspires to be neutral

An agile coach also works in quite similar ways to a sports coach. Whereas professional athletes know a lot about their sports and their main tool (the human body), many professional software developers are lacking in theoretical knowledge as well as practical experience. The barriers of entry into software development are very low and many software developers never receive sufficient formal education in their craft. At the same time, the pressure to release new features means that best practices are forgotten and people collect the wrong kinds of experience.
敏捷教练也会用到体育教练的类似方式进行工作。差别是专业运动员对运动和他们主要工具（人体）了解很多，但是许多专业软件开发人员是缺乏理论知识和实践经验的。 进入软件开发的门槛相对来说非常低，许多软件开发人员从来没有得到足够的正规的技能教育。 与此同时，新功能发布的压力意味着最佳实践被人遗忘，人们仅收获到各种错误的经验。

Exacerbating the issue, everyone wants to portray themselves as experts in order to keep their jobs. The more senior developers who could per- haps act as mentors and role models are all overworked, participating in dozens of critical projects and workgroups simultaneously. This means that agile coaches need to tread carefully when nurturing both basic software practices, as well as agile project/product management and team building practices.
这个问题越来越严重，每个人都想把自己描绘成专家来保住自己的工作。 那些能够担任导师和榜样的更高级的开发人员总是过度劳累的工作，要同时参与几十个关键项目和工作组。 这意味着敏捷教练需要认真对待和培养基础的软件实践，敏捷项目/产品的管理和团队建设的实践。

Every coach should always have a clear goal. Unfortunately, agile coaches are often called in to do something vague or implicit, such as “we’ve been told to deploy Scrum” or “my team isn’t meeting their sprint goals” or “could you just look at this team and say what’s wrong?” Part of your job is therefore to observe or quickly assess the organization, make a diagnosis or draw up some hypotheses and agree on the goal with your sponsor. Without an understanding of what the organization wants and needs, it is difficult to achieve results.
每个教练都应该有一个明确的目标。 不幸的是，敏捷教练经常被要求做一些模糊或隐含的事情，比如“我们被告知部署Scrum”或者“我的团队没有达到他们的冲刺目标”或者“你可以看看这个团队并且说出哪里不对？“因此，部分工作是观察或快速评估一个组织，作出诊断或制定一些假设，并与发起人的目标达成一致。 如果不了解组织的需要和需求，就很难取得成果。

To do this, you will need to allocate “access time” with the organization. In some cases, this might mean a concerted, structured assessment car- ried out in a very short time. Other times, it may be more informal and unstructured — to the extreme point of hanging around in the coffee room trying to meet and interview as many different people as possible.
为此，您需要为组织分配一些“访问时间”。 在某些情况下，这可能意味着在很短的时间内进行协调一致的评估。 其他时候，它可能非正式和非结构化一点，比如，多在咖啡室里闲逛，试图尽可能多地与不同的人见面。
