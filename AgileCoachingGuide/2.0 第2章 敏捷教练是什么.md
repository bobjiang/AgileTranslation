# #Chapter 2 What is agile coaching?
#第二章 初识敏捷教练技术

Agile coaching is the art of helping people see reality using an agile and lean perspective and change their paradigms, habits and roles accordingly. Agile coaching has two very different sides — agility and coaching — and you will need to know a bit of both. Being good or skilled in only one of these two domains is not sufficient.

敏捷教练技术是一门帮助人们以敏捷和精益的视角看待现实世界的艺术，并相应地改变他们的格局，习惯和角色。敏捷教练技术有两个截然不同的方面 - 敏捷性和教练性。你需要了解这两个方面，仅仅善长或熟练其中一个是不够的。

Agile is an umbrella term for all kinds of methods and practices that are based on the values and principles defined in the Agile Manifesto (“Agile Manifesto,” 2001). At present the most widely used agile methods are Scrum, Kanban and XP. When we refer to “agile”, we usually mean any and all of the agile methods, but we will sometimes specifically address one of the agile methods.

敏捷是基于“敏捷宣言”（“Agile Manifesto”，2001）定义的价值观和原则基础上的各种方法和实践的总称。 目前使用最广泛的敏捷方法是Scrum，Kanban（看板）和XP（极限编程）。当我们提到“敏捷”时，通常是指任何的敏捷方法，但我们有时会专指其中一种敏捷方法。

In our experience, most agile coaches typically have a background as ScrumMasters, project managers, general managers, process specialists or quality managers. Working with different teams, they have noticed that they can help the teams work better by introducing or strengthening the team’s agile thinking. At some point, they may start calling themselves agile coaches, or they keep their ScrumMaster title. Through failures and successes, they have slowly learned how to approach and work with different teams. They have started out as new agile coaches with reasonably good agile knowledge, but do not know enough about coaching. If you belong to this group, this book is for you.

根据我们的经验，大多数敏捷教练通常具有ScrumMaster，项目经理，总经理，流程专家或质量经理的背景。他们已经注意到，与不同的团队合作的时候，通过引入或加强团队的敏捷思维，他们可以帮助团队更好地工作。在某一时刻，他们可以开始自称敏捷教练，或者他们仍然保留Scrum Master的头衔。通过一些成功和失败，他们慢慢地学会了如何与不同的团队接触与合作。他们开始成为具有相当多的敏捷知识的新型敏捷教练，但是在教练技术方面还不足。如果你属于这一类人，那么这本书正是为你准备的。

Agile thinking and agile practices are easier to learn than coaching skills. There are agile books, Scrum training, workshops, conferences, communities and a lot more available, however for many people the main problem is, in fact, the unlearning of old thinking patterns.

学习敏捷思维和敏捷实践比掌握教练技术更容易一些。比如说，有敏捷方面的书籍、Scrum培训、工作坊、会议、社区等，都是很有用的学习途径。然而，对许多人来说，主要问题实际上是抛弃（忘记）旧有的思维模式。

Coaching is also a skill that you can pick up and improve on, although perhaps not as easily as agile knowledge. This is because coaching is a way of acting, almost a personal habit, and habits are notoriously difficult to change.

敏捷教练技术也许不像敏捷知识那样容易获得，但它其实是一种你可以增加和改进的技能。之所以难，是因为教练技术是一种行为方式，可以认为是一种个人习惯，而习惯是众所周知的不容易被改变的。

In order to become a good coach you must learn to observe and listen, to keep your own biases in control, to not jump to premature conclusions and to communicate well. This naturally affects how you are aware of yourself, how you react to other people and how others perceive you. Many people are unwilling to even start this journey. For example, people who enjoy the feeling of power that comes from bossing people around, do not necessarily want to give it up.
为了成为一名优秀的教练，你必须学会观察和倾听、克制自己的偏见、不过早地下结论并且保持良好的交流。 这自然会影响你对自己的认知、你对别人的反应、以及别人如何看待你。所以，许多人甚至不愿意开启这段旅程。比如说，沉浸在指挥别人的权力快感之中的人们，必然不想放弃这一切。

Agile coaching is not magical handwaving. It is a soft but very very structured skill. We don’t want to encourage the perception that an agile coach can just walk into an organization, talk to people, run some workshops, slap stickies on flipcharts and turn everyone superagile. Instead, we see agile coaching as structured and longterm work that stretches over months, sometimes years.
敏捷教练技术不是魔术手法。它是一种非常非常结构化的软技能。常常有这样的误区：敏捷教练走进一个组织、与人交谈、举办一些工作坊、在挂图上贴一些贴纸，他就能让每个人都超级敏捷起来。我们并不想鼓励这样的认识。相反，我们认为敏捷教练是一项结构化的、需要延续数月甚至数年的长期工作。

The difference between a newly started agile coach and an expert coach is simply that the expert knows more structures by heart and remembers more tools; and has more experience to help her choose the right tool or structure for the job. Where an experienced coach can pick and choose from memory, new coaches may need to consult lists, books or mentors and are perhaps more likely to occasionally choose the wrong tool for the job. We hope that this book will give you the tools and structures you need to become an effective agile coach.
新晋的敏捷教练和专家级教练的区别在于：专家知道更多的结构，记得更多的工具；并有更多的经验来帮助她选择正确的工具或结构。有经验的教练可以从记忆中选择合适的工具和方法，而新晋教练可能需要查询清单、书籍或咨询导师，可能偶尔会选错工具。我们希望这本书能给你提供所需要的工具和结构，使你成为令人印象深刻的敏捷教练。

We would encourage you to think of coaching as an additional set of tools in your leadership toolbox. Coaching is something you can try out and adopt gradually, tool by tool and technique by technique; and it is very likely that you will find the skills and tools in this book useful in many different situations. For example, the skill of listening will be very convenient when interacting with customers and colleagues, as well as your mother-in-law.
我们想鼓励你把教练技能看作是领导力工具箱中的一套附加工具。 教练技能是你可以逐步尝试和采用的不同工具与技术；很有可能你会发现本书中的工具和技巧，在许多不同的场合都很有用。 例如，倾听的技巧，在你跟客户和同事交流的时候很实用，在与你的婆婆（或岳母）交流的时候，也一样管用。
