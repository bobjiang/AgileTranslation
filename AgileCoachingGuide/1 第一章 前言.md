Agile coaching is at heart not such a complicated thing. It is the art of observing, listening, forming an understanding and validating it, then working with the coachee to come up with and enact solutions. By coaching and observing others coach, you build up your own collection of patterns and tools. Where a junior coach will have to rely on written material and the support of others, an experienced coach can quickly form and validate hypotheses and pick the right tools from the toolbox.
从本质上讲，敏捷教练工作并不复杂。它是一门集观察、倾听、形成理解和验证为一体的艺术，然后教练与受训者一起提出并制定解决方案。作为教练，你可以通过辅导实践和观察其他教练，不断积累自己的教授模式和工具集合。当一名初级教练还不得不依赖书面材料和其他人的支持时，资深教练就已经可以快速建立验证假设并从工具箱中挑选正确工具加以运用了。

But starting out as a new agile coach is not so easy. Where do you go? How do you get started? With this book we wanted to create an introductory reference for new agile coaches as well as experienced ScrumMasters. It contains much of the theory that we teach our new colleagues at agile42 and hopefully a lot of insights for new coaches. The intention was to provide a secondary source for what we teach as a lasting memory to hand out to clients and students. We decided to publish it so that even more people can enjoy the results.
但作为新入行的敏捷教练，一开始也并不是那么容易的。该怎么开始？将何去何从？作者希望通过出版该书，以便将所教授的东西（其中包含的许多理论曾被用来辅导其在agile42的新同事）以文字形式长久保存，为初级敏捷教练以及资深ScrumMaster提供一个入门的参考，给他们带来启发。

What you are reading right now is the book we wish we had had when we started out as agile coaches.
这也正是作者当年开始做敏捷教练时所渴望读到的一本书。

Despite the title this book is not about agility as such. We will assume that the reader has a working knowledge of all things agile. We may touch on the agile principles and lean thinking in this book, but we are not going to explain e.g. why it makes sense to slice large work items into smaller independent pieces, or how to choose between synchronized and unsynchronized releases. There are plenty of good books around for those purposes.
阅读本书的前提是读者已具备对敏捷的基本认知，故作者未通过书名彰显本书的“敏捷性”。尽管本书会涉及敏捷原则和精益思考，但并未打算解释为什么将大型工作项切片为较小的独立块、或者如何在同步和不同步的版本之间进行选择，毕竟坊间已有不少关于上述话题的好书了。

We have tried to introduce the topics sequentially, so that later chapters build on top of previous ones. The book therefore wanders between different topics, although there is a clear path from listening to one-on-one coaching and onward to team coaching and how to empirically influence the behavior of a team. We do recommend that you at least skim the preceding chapters before jumping into later chapters.
作者试图按顺序介绍这些主题，以便后面章节的内容可以建立在前一章节的基础之上。从“聆听一对一指导”到“团队指导”，以及“如何从经验上影响团队的行为”，本书尽管有一条清晰的写作思路，但会在不同的主题之间切换，所以建议读者至少略读前几章，然后再跳转到后面的章节。

Throughout the book we will use the term agile coach, but don’t take that too literally. It’s an umbrella term that covers everyone interested in coaching agile teams and small organizations. We don’t expect that every reader wants to become an agile coach. Rather we have designed and written this book to be useful to a large number of people including ScrumMasters, development managers and system thinkers. So whenever you see “agile coach”, please substitute it with whatever title you feel is appropriate for you.
尽管本书中使用了“敏捷教练”这个术语，但请读者不要太当真。这是一个涵盖“所有对敏捷团队和小型组织有兴趣的人”的统称。作者出版本书，并不期待每位读者都想成为一名敏捷教练，而是希望对包括ScrumMaster、开发经理和系统思考者在内的许多人都是有用的。所以，当你看到“敏捷教练”时，请用认为适合阁下的任何头衔来代替它。

That said, some parts of this book are written for people who see a lot of different teams, either inside one organization or across many companies. ScrumMasters, development managers and internal agile coaches typically work with the same teams year after year. Agile coaches, on the other hand, are expected to train and coach teams from scratch until they become self-sufficient in Scrum, which usually takes 2–3 months, before moving on to other teams. Over time a consulting agile coach will find herself working with many different teams in many different contexts and with many different goals. We have therefore included some material relevant to working with new teams. There are chapters and sections in this book dedicated to team building models, or what you can do to help your teams perform better.
也就是说，本书的某些部分是为那些观察很多不同团队的人编写的，无论是在组织内还是跨越了多个组织。比如说，ScrumMaster、开发经理和内部敏捷教练通常会固定地和一些团队合作，也可能是从头开始培训和指导团队，直到他们在Scrum中变得能够自给自足后（通常需要2-3个月的时间）再转去其他团队。久而久之，和他们合作的团队会越来越多，而且这些团队所处的环境、所设定的目标都是各不相同的。因此，本书包含了一些如何与新团队合作的材料，其中有部分章节专门介绍团队建设模型、以及如何提升团队的表现。

At this point you may be wondering who these guys behind the book really are. We are agile coaches working at what we believe is the most awesome agile coaching company, agile42. Since this book was written by a team, we have chosen not to stand out individually. Instead, we have been writing this book as if it were software developed by a team.
在这一点上，读者可能想知道这本书背后的作者是谁。事实上，我们是敏捷教练，在我们认为是最棒的敏捷培训公司agile42工作。由于这本书是由一个团队编写的，所以我们选择不单独站出来。相反，我们一直在写这本书，就好像它是由一个团队开发的软件一样。

This means that we started by formulating a strategic goal for why this book should be brought to life. We drew up a product vision from the user perspective; we named and described personas and created a story map. By planning tasks and visualizing them on a kanban board, we wrote the book through an iterative and incremental process. We focused on first developing a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) through a number of Minimal Marketable Features (MMF). What you see here is the MVP. For the software geeks among you, the book was entirely written using markdown files in a git repository with a continuous integration build using pandoc to create various formats of the book.
于是，我们设定了一个目标：为这本书赋予生命。我们从用户角度制定了产品愿景，我们命名并描述了角色，并创建了一个故事地图。借助于任务规划并在看板上对其进行可视化的过程，我们用增量迭代的方式来撰写该书。我们致力于首先通过一些最小可销售组件（Minimal Marketable Feature，MMF），开发出最小可用产品（Minimal Viable Product，MVP）。所以，你看到的眼前这本书是一个MVP的版本。而且，令读者中的软件极客一族兴奋的是，这本书完全是用git仓库中的markdown文件格式编写的，使用pandoc进行持续集成构建，可用于创建本书的各种格式。

Becoming an agile coach is a journey that has no end. And that’s why the name of this book is “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Agile Coaching.”
成为一名敏捷教练是一段没有终点的旅程。这就是为什么这本书的名字是“敏捷教练旅行指南”。
