Asking the right questions is a challenging task, especially when you do not want to impose your own opinion on to the person or team you are talking to. Great coaching questions are open-ended, non-judging and help foster new ideas and visions about possibilities. These kind of questions we call *powerful questions* (see fig. 3.4).

问正确的问题是一个有挑战的任务，特别是当你不想把自己的意见强加在你要聊的那个人或团队上。很棒的教练问题是开放式的、不带评判的、并且可以激发出新的多种可能性的想法和视角。这样的问题，我们称之为 *强有力的问题*（见图3.4）。

Figure 3.4: Powerful Questions

图3.4：强有力的问题



There are several approaches to creating powerful questions. They depend on which coaching school you are coming from. One approach is to practice a deck of questions until you know them by heart which helps you choose the right one in a given situation. Another approach is to learn a strategy for designing the right questions as needed. One such strategy that we have found works particularly well with both individuals and teams is based on a model developed by Canadian psychologist Karl Tomm.

提出强有力的问题有很多种方式。这取决于你是来自哪所教练学校的。一种方式是练习一套问题直到你把这些问题烂熟于心。这可以帮助你在特定情境下选择一个合适的问题。另一种方式是学习一个策略可以按需设计正确问题。我们发现有这样一个策略，对个人和团队都特别有效。这个策略就是基于加拿大心理学家Karl Tomm开发的模型。

### The past and the future — simple and complex assumptions

### 过去和未来 —— 简单和复杂的假设

The Karl Tomm approach has its roots in systemic theory. It encapsulates circularity and the understanding that each of us has a different perspective of the facts in a given situation and is entitled to that view. No one has monopoly on the truth; indeed different people can have very different perspectives and hence different understandings of what is happening and why.

Karl Tomm的方式来源于系统化理论。它包含了循环并且理解我们中的每一个人在特定情境下对事实都有不同的见解，而每个人都有资格有不同的观点。 没有人可以垄断真相；但确实是不同的人会有非常不同的见解，因此人们会对正在发生什么和为什么会发生有不同的理解。



The model in fig. 3.5 shows two dimensions. Time is shown on the horizontal axis as *the past* and *the future* . On the vertical axis we can find *simple* (obvious, evident, linear) and *complex* (non-evident, multi-path, circular). While time should be easy to understand, the concept of simplicity vs. complexity may require a bit of explanation.

图3.5的模型有两个维度。水平轴显示了时间，标志过去和未来。垂直轴上，我们可以看到*简单* （明显的、有证据的、线性的），以及*复杂* （没有证据的、多路径的、循环的）。时间轴很容易理解，而 简单和复杂的概念可能需要一点解释。

Figure 3.5: Karl Tomm’s model for asking Powerful Questions

图3.5：Karl Tomm的问强有力问题的模型



In a simple and linear world, there is little room for doubt. Cause-and-effect relations are easy to see and everybody can correctly predict the result of any given action. In the complex world, however, you generally can’t draw a straight line from cause to effect. There can be multiple interacting causes, not all of them visible. There may also be circular cause-and-effect chains of different lengths, for example vicious loops
and virtuous cycles. In a complex, circular world people may have quite different interpretations of why something happened the way it did, and sometimes even different opinions on what exactly happened.

在一个简单和线性的世界里，没有什么疑惑的空间。因果关系容易被看到，并且所有人都能根据任何特定的动作预测出结果。而在复杂的世界里，你一般不能直接从因到果画一条直线。可能会有许多交互的原因，而且并不是所有原因都可见。可能也会有不同长度的因果循环链，比如良性循环和恶性循环。在一个复杂的、循环的世界，人们对为什么一些事情这样发生有着极其不同的解读，有时候甚至对真的发生了什么也有不同的见解。



Powerful questions are anchored in all four quadrants of Karl Tomm’s model. The powerful questions can be aimed either at what has already happened (past-oriented), or at what could happen (future-oriented).
The powerful questions can also be designed on the presumption that there is one and only one truth (linear questions) or so that they acknowledge the diversity in our understanding of the truth (circular questions).

强有力的问题在Karl Tomm模型的所有四个象限都存在。强有力的问题针对的即是那些已经发生的（过去的方向），也是将来可能发生的（未来的方向）。强有力的问题也可以基于前置假设比如有且只有一个真相的时候（线性问题）或者基于我们对真相理解的多样性（循环问题）。



When we ask questions that are past-oriented and linear (upper left in fig. 3.5), we ask questions like a detective in an interrogation, for example:

• “What happened then?”
• “What kind of velocity did you have before that?”
• “When did it happen?”
• “How did it work out?”
• “Was it the PO or the customer?”

当我们问那些过去的线性的问题（图3.5 左上角）时，我们会像侦探在讯问中一样提出问题，例如：

* “之后发生了什么？”
* “你们在这之前的速度怎么样？”
* “什么时候发生的？”
* “它是如何运作的？”
* “是PO还是客户？”



As a detective, we are looking for facts that help us understand the issue. Remember that facts are undisputable: something either happened or it did not happen.[^6]  All kinds of data, statistics, recordings, diaries, blog posts, e-mails etc. are welcome.

作为侦探，我们查找帮助我们理解问题的事实。记住这些事实是不用争辩的：要么已经发生，要么没有发生。[^6]所有的数据、统计、记录、日志、博客、邮件等等都是欢迎的。



But even when people are in the same place at the same time, they often end up with different observations. Memories have a tendency to evaporate over time. People fill in with assumptions when they don’t have all the facts. This means that people can have very different interpretations of various events. Hidden assumptions are a major source of conflict and unearthing them can help immensely.

但是即使人们在同一地点同一时间，他们也经常会有不同的观察。记忆有可能会随着时间而蒸发。人们在没有完整的事实的时候，会填充一些假设。这意味着人们对各种繁杂的事件会有非常不同的解读。隐藏的假设是矛盾的主要来源，挖掘这些假设可以极大的帮助我们发现真相。

[^6]: As far as we know, this is the case everywhere except in Washington DC, where it might be helpful to explicitly say “a true fact”. 据我们所知，除华盛顿特区外，其他地方都是如此，明确说出“真实事实”可能会有所帮助。

When we ask questions that are past-oriented and circular (lower left in the picture), we ask questions like an anthropologist doing research. We are looking for intentions and expanding our understanding of the intentions. For example, we could ask:

• “What do you think was their motivation to do so?”
• “From which point of view could her action make sense?”
• “Could it be that they knew something that the rest of you did not? What could it be?”
• “Do you think she saw this as a problem at all?”

当我们询问面向过去的循环的问题时（图的左下方），我们会像人类学家做研究一样问问题。我们探寻事情的意图并扩大我们对意图的理解。例如，我们会问：

- “你认为他们这样做的动机是什么？”
- “从什么角度看，她的行为才是有意义的？”
- “是不是他们知道其他人没有的东西？会是什么呢？”
- “你认为她究竟是否认为这是一个问题？”

Future-oriented circular questions (lower right) are intended to explore opportunities and different scenarios and expand possibilities. Here we ask questions like a future researcher, such as:
• “What could you do to make things better?”
• “Is there something you could do to prevent this from happening in the future?”
• “Can you see a possible solution to this problem?”

面向未来的循环的问题（右下方）是为了探寻机会和不同的场景，并扩大可能性。这里，我们会像一个未来的研究员一样问问题，比如：

- “你能做些什么来让事情变得更好？”
- “有什么可以做的，以防止未来类似情况的发生？”
- “你能想到这个问题可能的解决方案吗？”



It can also be useful to apply appreciative inquiry and heliotropism to explore a positive and compelling future rather than focus on the problems and issues. One trick is to ask a “miracle question”; something that suggests that a miracle has happened overnight:
• “If you come to work tomorrow and the problem has unexpectedly disappeared, how would you notice that?”
• “One day when you have solved this matter and look back on this period in time, which decisions did you make that made a difference?”

应用欣赏式询问和heliotropism去探索一个积极的引人注目的未来而不是专注于问题本身，会很有用。一个技巧是问一个“奇迹问题“；比如假设一个奇迹一夜之间发生了：

- “如果你明天上班，问题出乎意料的消失了，你会如何注意到这一点？“
- “有一天你解决了这个问题，当你回头看这个过程，你会做什么决定来让结果变得不同？”



Questions in this future-oriented, circular category might seem a bit strange at first, but give it a try. The advantage of questions like this is that they disconnect the person or team in front of you from the constrained situation they are currently in. They free up energy to see new perspectives and decide on new courses of action based on those perspectives. They help the person or team to see which part of the miracle or the desired future are already present today and how they can be used as stepping stones towards the goal.

面向未来的循环的问题一开始可能会看起来有点奇怪，但是你要试一下。这些问题的优势是让您面前的个人或团队脱离当前局限的窘境。这些问题帮助人们释放出精力看到新的观点，并根据这些观点决定新的行动方案。这些问题帮助个人或团队了解奇迹或未来希望的哪一部分今天已经存在，以及基于现有的存在的部分如何一步步实现目标。

Finally, we can ask simple or linear future-oriented questions (upper right). These are the kind of questions that a captain would ask. They are more direct and practical, defining the next steps for the desired change:
• “What is the first thing you are going to do now?”
• “Who do you need to talk to in order to move this forward”
• “How can he or she help you?”
• “How will I know that you have done this?”

最后，我们也会问一些简单的、线性的、面向未来的问题（右上角）。这是船长会问的那种问题。它们更加直接和实用，并声明了需要做的下一步骤：

* “你现在要做的第一件事是什么？”
* “为了推动这项工作，你需要与谁谈话？”
* “他或她要如何帮助你？”
* “我怎么知道你做了这件事？”



Like at the end of a retrospective, this is where specific tasks are defined and prepared for action. As the coach your role is to ensure that the tasks are clear and simple, but also that the coachee takes responsibility. You can look back at sec. 3.5 for inspiration and more examples.

就像回顾结束的时候，这里需要确定具体任务并准备采取行动。作为教练，您的角色是确保任务清晰简单，同时也确保被教练者承担起责任来。你可以回头看看3.5章寻找一些灵感和更多的例子。



### It is like driving a car

### 这就像驾驶一辆汽车

When coaching someone, we are mostly looking at the future and the change we are going to make. However, from time to time we must look back into the past to understand what has happened and why we are in the current situation. It is like driving a car; we are mostly looking out the windshield at the traffic in front of us, but from time to time we also need to look in the rear-view mirrors to know what is behind us.

在指导某人时，我们主要关注未来以及我们将要做出的改变。 然而，我们必须时不时地回顾过去，了解发生了什么以及我们为什么处于目前的状况。 这就像驾驶一辆汽车；我们大多数时候都透过挡风玻璃看到我们面前的交通状况，但是我们还需要时不时地在后视镜中看看，以了解我们身后是什么。

There is no specific route you must follow when using Karl Tomm’s discussion model. We have found that most of our coaching conversations tend to start in the detective dimension, moving on to the perspective of an anthropologist, then investigate as the future researcher and finally ending up as the captain. This is the order in which we introduced the quadrants in the previous section. You can imagine drawing the letter “U” over fig. 3.5, starting from the upper left. The path is not necessarily linear, though. On your way, you can jump back and forth as intuition tells you.

在使用Karl Tomm的讨论模型时，您也不必遵循特定的路线。我们发现，我们大部分的辅导对话都倾向于从侦探角度开始，转向人类学家的视角，然后像未来研究人员调查，最后以船长角色结束。 这是我们在前一节介绍象限的顺序。 您可以想象在图3.5上画一个字母“U”，从左上角开始。然而这个路径也不一定是线性的。在你自己的方法中，您可以凭直觉在不同象限中来回跳动。

You have already learned about conversation flow, active listening and identifying keywords. You are now adding powerful questions to your toolbox of coaching skills. Asking powerful questions is a valuable coaching skill and one that can be improved with practice.

您已经了解了对话流程，主动聆听和识别关键词汇。您现在可以为您的教练技能工具箱增加强有力的问题了。提出强有力的问题是一种有价值的辅导技能，并且可以通过练习而改进。

### Critics are saying

### 批评家如是说

When first exposed to powerful questions, your coachee or team members might think: *“What the heck is this guy up to?”*  Especially if you are asking miracle questions. You may also personally feel a bit uncomfortable using these kind of questions. We recommend that you review your questions during and after the discussion, thinking back to which questions resulted in interesting and worthwhile answers and which questions seemed to break the flow or perhaps even offend the other person.

当第一次接触到强有力的问题时，你的被教练者或团队成员可能会想：*“这个人到底想要干嘛？”* 特别是如果你问奇迹问题时。使用这些问题你自己也可能会感到有些不舒服。我们建议您在讨论期间和讨论后回顾您的问题，回想一下哪些问题会产生有趣而有价值的答案，以及哪些问题似乎打断了流程，甚至可能冒犯了其他人。

Especially questions from the anthropologist perspective are usually grounded in the belief that behind any action, there are good intentions.[^7] Not everybody believes in this postulate and we must admit that we also regularly have to remind ourselves about it. Nevertheless, taking this approach will let you help people reflect as well as help solving conflicts.

特别是来自人类学家视角的问题通常是基于相信任何行动背后都有良好的意图。[^7]并非每个人都相信这个假设，我们必须承认我们也不得不经常提醒自己这点。尽管如此，采取这种方式可以帮助人们反思并帮助解决冲突。

You may also find it useful to remember that in any given situation, people try to do the best they can with the information and tools they have. We will return to the *Prime directive of retrospectives*  by Norman Kerth in sec. 6.4.

你也许发现记住这点会很有用，那就是在任何特定情况下，人们都会用他们所拥有的信息和工具尽力做到最好。 我们将在6.4节回来讨论Norman Kerth的*Prime directive of retrospectives*。

[^7]: As stated by Humberto Maturana, one of the founders of the Systemic Theory. 正如系统论理论的创始人之一Humberto Maturana所述。

While powerful questions are useful, they are not a silver bullet. For example, we sometimes run across teams that feel powerless, suppressed, oppressed or victimized. They may be stuck complaining about the past and refuse to move on to imagining a future. *“Yes, we tried something like that four years ago and it didn’t work.”* There are strategies for dealing with such teams, such as arranging a quick win in some area just to show that change can indeed happen or enlisting managers to help (although often the managers are part of the problem).

尽管强有力的问题是有用的，但它们不是银弹。例如，我们有时会遇到无力的、抑郁的、压迫的或受害的团队。 他们可能会总在抱怨过去，拒绝进一步想象未来。*“是的，我们在四年前尝试过类似的做法，但这种做法并不奏效。”* 与这类团队打交道也有些策略，比如在某些领域迅速取胜以表明变化确实可能生效，又或者可以招募管理人员来帮忙（尽管经理往往是问题的一部分）。

### Try this

### 尝试这个

1. Think of a possible coaching situation. It can either be with a team or with a person one on one. It might be a coaching conversation you already had with someone or you may be preparing for an upcoming coaching situation. 

  Try walking around in the Karl Tomm model and formulate questions from the four different perspectives. Formulate at least three questions in each dimension. You might have to imagine the answers you will get in order to formulate new questions. 

  Next, practice asking powerful questions in live coaching situations. You can also use them in situations you would not normally consider to be coaching situations, like in Daily Scrum for example.

2. When you are in a suitable coaching conversation, spend some extra effort at the beginning of the conversation separating facts from interpretations. Write statements and keywords on stickies and put them on a Karl Tomm model on a whiteboard. Ask questions that help you understand whether a statement is a fact or an assumption and recategorize the stickies as necessary. 

  *“The PO moved a difficult backlog item from their backlog to ours”* is a fact, while *“the PO did it because he thinks the other team doesn't like difficult backlog items”* would be an interpretation.



1. 想想一个可能的教练情况。可能是与一个团队或是与一个人一对一。这可能是您与某人已经进行过的教练对话，或者您可能正在为即将到来的教练情境做准备。

   尝试走读一下Karl Tomm模型，并从四个不同的角度组织问题。在每个维度中至少提出三个问题。您可能不得不想像一下可能得到的答案，从而提出新的问题。

   接下来，在真实的教练情境下，练习提出强有力的问题。您也可以在通常不认为是教练情境的情况下使用它们，例如在Daily Scrum中。

2. 当您正在一个恰当的教练谈话时，在谈话开始时，多花一些精力将事实与解释分开。在便签条上写下描述和关键词，并将它们贴在白板上的Karl Tomm模型上。询问有助于您理解描述是事实还是假设的问题，并根据需要重新分类便签贴。

   *“PO将一个有难度的待办事项从他们的待办事项列表转移到我们的里面”* 是一个事实，而*“PO这样做是因为他认为其他团队不喜欢有难度的待办事项”* 一种解释。
