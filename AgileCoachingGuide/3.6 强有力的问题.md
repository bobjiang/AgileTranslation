Asking the right questions is a challenging task, especially when you do
not want to impose your own opinion on to the person or team you
are talking to. Great coaching questions are open-ended, non-judging
and help foster new ideas and visions about possibilities. These kind of
questions we call *powerful questions* (see fig. 3.4).

问正确的问题是一个有挑战的任务，特别是当你不想把自己的意见强加在你要聊的那个人或团队上。很棒的教练问题是开放式的、不带评判的、并且可以激发出新的多种可能性的想法和视角。这样的问题，我们称之为 *强有力的问题*（见图3.4）。

图3.4：强有力的问题



There are several approaches to creating powerful questions. They depend
on which coaching school you are coming from. One approach
is to practice a deck of questions until you know them by heart which
helps you choose the right one in a given situation. Another approach is
to learn a strategy for designing the right questions as needed. One such
strategy that we have found works particularly well with both individuals
and teams is based on a model developed by Canadian psychologist
Karl Tomm.

提出强有力的问题有很多种方式。这取决于你是来自哪所教练学校的。一种方式是练习一套问题直到你把这些问题烂熟于心。这可以帮助你在特定情境下选择一个合适的问题。另一种方式是学习一个策略可以按需设计正确问题。我们发现有这样一个策略，对个人和团队都特别有效。这个策略就是基于加拿大心理学家Karl Tomm的开发的模型。

### The past and the future — simple and complex assumptions

### 过去和未来 —— 简单和复杂的假设

The Karl Tomm approach has its roots in systemic theory. It encapsulates
circularity and the understanding that each of us has a different
perspective of the facts in a given situation and is entitled to that view.
No one has monopoly on the truth; indeed different people can have
very different perspectives and hence different understandings of what
is happening and why.

Karl Tomm的方式来源于系统化理论。它包含了系统回路并且理解我们中的每一个人在特定情境下对事实都有不同的见解，and is entitled to that view. 没有人可以垄断真相；但确实是不同的人会有非常不同的见解，因此人们会对正在发生什么和为什么会发生有不同的理解。



The model in fig. 3.5 shows two dimensions. Time is shown on the horizontal
axis as *the past* and *the future* . On the vertical axis we can 

find *simple* (obvious, evident, linear) and *complex* (non-evident, multi-path,
circular). While time should be easy to understand, the concept of simplicity
vs. complexity may require a bit of explanation.

图3.5的模型有两个维度。水平轴显示了时间，标志过去和未来。垂直轴上，我们可以看到*简单* （明显的、有证据的、线性的），以及*复杂* （没有证据的，多路径的，循环的）。时间轴很容易理解，然而 简单和复杂的概念可能需要一点解释。

Figure 3.5: Karl Tomm’s model for asking Powerful Questions

图3.5：Karl Tomm的问强有力问题的模型。



In a simple and linear world, there is little room for doubt. Cause-and-effect
relations are easy to see and everybody can correctly predict the
result of any given action. In the complex world, however, you generally
can’t draw a straight line from cause to effect. There can be multiple
interacting causes, not all of them visible. There may also be circular
cause-and-effect chains of different lengths, for example vicious loops
and virtuous cycles. In a complex, circular world people may have quite
different interpretations of why something happened the way it did, and
sometimes even different opinions on what exactly happened.

在一个简单和线性的世界里，没有什么疑惑的空间。因果关系容易被看到，并且所有人都能根据任何特定的动作预测出结果。而在复杂的世界里，你一般不能直接从因画一条直线到果。可能会有许多交互的原因，而且并不是所有原有都可见。也可能会有不同长度的因果循环链，比如良性循环和恶性循环。在一个复杂的、循环的世界，人们对为什么一些事情这样发生有极其不同的解读，并且有时候甚至对真的发生了什么也有不同的见解。



Powerful questions are anchored in all four quadrants of Karl Tomm’s
model. The powerful questions can be aimed either at what has already
happened (past-oriented), or at what could happen (future-oriented).
The powerful questions can also be designed on the presumption that
there is one and only one truth (linear questions) or so that they acknowledge
the diversity in our understanding of the truth (circular questions).

强有力的问题在Karl Tomm模型的所有四个象限都存在。强有力的问题针对的即是那些已经发生的（过去的方向），也是将来可能发生的（未来的方向）。强有力的问题也可以基于前置假设比如有且只有一个真相的时候（线性问题）或者基于我们对真相理解的多样性（循环问题）。



When we ask questions that are past-oriented and linear (upper left in
fig. 3.5), we ask questions like a detective in an interrogation, for example:

• “What happened then?”
• “What kind of velocity did you have before that?”
• “When did it happen?”
• “How did it work out?”
• “Was it the PO or the customer?”

当我们问那些过去的线性的问题（图3.5 左上角），我们会像侦探在讯问中一样问问题，例如：

* “之后发生了什么？”
* “你们在这之前的速度怎么样？”
* “什么时候发生的？”
* “怎么看出有效的？”
* “这是PO还是客户？”



As a detective, we are looking for facts that help us understand the issue.
Remember that facts are undisputable: something either happened or
it did not happen.[^6]  All kinds of data, statistics, recordings, diaries, blog
posts, e-mails etc. are welcome.

作为侦探，我们查找帮助我们理解问题的事实。记住这些事实是不用争辩的：要么已经发生，要么没有发生。[^6]所有的数据、统计、记录、日志、博客、邮件等等都是欢迎的。



But even when people are in the same place at the same time, they often
end up with different observations. Memories have a tendency to
evaporate over time. People fill in with assumptions when they don’t
have all the facts. This means that people can have very different interpretations
of various events. Hidden assumptions are a major source of
conflict and unearthing them can help immensely.

但是即使人们在同一地点同一时间，他们也经常有不同的观察。记忆有可能会随着时间而蒸发。人们在没有完整的事实的时候，会填充一些假设。这意味着人们对各种繁杂的事件会有非常不同的解读。隐藏的假设是矛盾的主要来源，挖掘这些假设可以极大的帮助我们发现真相。

[^6]: As far as we know, this is the case everywhere except in Washington DC, where it might be helpful to explicitly say “a true fact”. 据我们所知，除华盛顿特区外，其他地方都是如此，明确说出“真实事实”可能会有所帮助。

When we ask questions that are past-oriented and circular (lower left
in the picture), we ask questions like an anthropologist doing research.

We are looking for intentions and expanding our understanding of the
intentions. For example, we could ask:
• “What do you think was their motivation to do so?”
• “From which point of view could her action make sense?”
• “Could it be that they knew something that the rest of you did not?
What could it be?”
• “Do you think she saw this as a problem at all?”

当我们问面向过去的循环的问题时（图的左下方），我们像人类学家做研究一样问问题。我们探寻事情的意图并扩大我们对意图的理解。例如，我们会问：

- “你认为他们这样做的动机图和？”
- “从什么角度看，她的行为才是有意义的？”
- “是不是他们知道其他人没有的东西？会是什么呢？”
- “你认为她究竟是否认为这是一个问题吗？”

Future-oriented circular questions (lower right) are intended to explore
opportunities and different scenarios and expand possibilities. Here we
ask questions like a future researcher, such as:
• “What could you do to make things better?”
• “Is there something you could do to prevent this from happening in
the future?”
• “Can you see a possible solution to this problem?”

面向未来的循环的问题（右下方）是为了探寻机会和不同的场景，并扩大可能性。这里，我们会像一个未来的研究员一样问问题，比如：

- “你能做些什么来让事情变得更好？”
- “有什么可以做的，以防止未来类似情况的发生？”
- “你能想到这个问题的可能的解决方案吗？”



It can also be useful to apply appreciative inquiry and heliotropism to
explore a positive and compelling future rather than focus on the problems
and issues. One trick is to ask a “miracle question”; something that
suggests that a miracle has happened overnight:
• “If you come to work tomorrow and the problem has unexpectedly
disappeared, how would you notice that?”
• “One day when you have solved this matter and look back on this
period in time, which decisions did you make that made a difference?”

应用欣赏式探寻和heliotropism去探索一个积极的引人注目的未来而不是专注于问题，会很有用。一个技巧是问一个“奇迹问题“；比如假设一个奇迹一夜之间发生了：

- “如果你明天上班，问题出乎意料的消失了，你会如何注意到这一点？“
- “有一天你解决了这个问题，当你回头看这个过程，你会做什么决定来让结果变得不同？”



Questions in this future-oriented, circular category might seem a bit
strange at first, but give it a try. The advantage of questions like this

is that they disconnect the person or team in front of you from the constrained
situation they are currently in. They free up energy to see new
perspectives and decide on new courses of action based on those perspectives.
They help the person or team to see which part of the miracle
or the desired future are already present today and how they can be used
as stepping stones towards the goal.

面向未来的循环的问题一开始可能会看起来有点奇怪，但是你要试一下。这些问题的优势是让你面前的个人或团队脱离当前局限的窘境。这些问题帮助人们释放出精力看到新的观点，并根据这些观点决定新的行动方案。这些问题帮助个人或团队了解奇迹或未来希望的哪一部分今天已经存在，以及基于现有的存在的部分如何一步步实现目标。

Finally, we can ask simple or linear future-oriented questions (upper
right). These are the kind of questions that a captain would ask. They are
more direct and practical, defining the next steps for the desired change:
• “What is the first thing you are going to do now?”
• “Who do you need to talk to in order to move this forward”
• “How can he or she help you?”
• “How will I know that you have done this?”

最后，我们也会问一些简单的、线性的、面向未来的问题（右上角）。这是船长会问的那种问题。 它们更加直接和实用，声明了需要做的下一步骤：

* “你现在要做的第一件事是什么？”
* “为了推动这项工作，你需要与谁谈话？”
* “他或她要如何帮助你？”
* “我怎么知道你做了这件事？”



Like at the end of a retrospective, this is where specific tasks are defined
and prepared for action. As the coach your role is to ensure that the tasks
are clear and simple, but also that the coachee takes responsibility. You
can look back at sec. 3.5 for inspiration and more examples.

就像回顾结束的时候，这里需要确定具体任务并准备采取行动。作为教练，您的角色是确保任务清晰简单，同时也确保coachee承担起责任来。你可以回头看看3.5章寻找一些灵感和更多的例子。
