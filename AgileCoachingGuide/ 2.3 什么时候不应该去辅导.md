###### 2.3 When not to coach
“It can be very dangerous to see things
from somebody else’s point of view
without the proper training.”
— Douglas Adams

Coaching requires a certain objectivity and it is difficult to coach people
you deeply care for. Avoid coaching your family, friends or close business partners unless they really ask for it. Even then you might want to
make clear that it’s a one-off thing. Get out of your home or office, go
to a coffee shop or take a walk while you discuss. And when the coaching session ends, remember to step out of the coaching mode and be
yourself.

Sometimes you will meet individuals who mistake coaching for therapy
or are messed up beyond the help of a coach. Coaching is not therapy. In
these cases, we recommend that you gently back off and stay in coaching territory. This is primarily because amateur therapists can do serious damage, but also giving therapy is probably not what you were
engaged for.

Now, of course, there are agile coaches who are also trained and licensed therapists. There might be situations where somebody engages such a trained and licensed therapist in order to give therapy to individuals or teams. If this is the situation, we are quite sure that you know it and can handle it. In all other cases, we recommend that you step back and let
professionals with the right skills handle the issue.

How do you recognize that you are coaching a person who needs therapy more than coaching? The best advice we have heard is from a pilot
in the context of landing an airplane: If you are in doubt, then you are not
in doubt! Meaning that if you suspect that you are on the wrong path,
then act as if you are on the wrong path

###### 2.3 什么时候不应该去辅导
没有合适的培训时，从别人的角度去观察判断，是一件很危险的选择

— Douglas Adams

辅导需要一定的客观性，这样的话去辅导你非常关心的人会有一定难度。避免给你的家人、朋友或亲密的商业伙伴提供辅导，除非他们真的请求你的帮助。即使这样，你也可能想要弄清楚这是一次性的事情。那么离开你的家或办公室，去去咖啡店或散步讨论交流。当辅导过程结束时，记得要走出辅导模式跟自己之前一样。

有时你会遇到一些人他们误以为辅导就是纠错，或者他们在教练的帮助下搞砸了。要明确的的是，辅导不是纠错。在这些情况，我们建议温和地退后一步，回到教练的领域。理由是，在纠错方面业余的人可能会带来严重的伤害，何况给出纠错方案也可能不是你所从事的工作。


当然，也有一些敏捷教练也接受过培训和专业治疗师资格认证。可能会有这样的情况，这些受过治疗培训和有治疗师执照的敏捷教练给个人或者团队提供专业治疗。如果是这种情况，我们很确定你知道，也可以很好处理它。在所有其他情况下，我们建议您后退一步拥有合适技能的专业人士处理这个问题。

你如何识别你在指导一个人，而这个人需要治疗比指导更多。我们听到的最佳建议是一名飞行员在飞机着陆的情况下：如果你处于怀疑中,那么你没有.言下之意是如果你怀疑自己在错误的轨道上，那么表现为你好像就在错误的轨道上。
