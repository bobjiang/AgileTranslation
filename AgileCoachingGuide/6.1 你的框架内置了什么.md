6.1 你的框架里内置了什么
---
What is built into your framework?

The framework you have chosen supports coaching in certain ways. Scrum conveniently provides a number of pre-scheduled meetings and touch points with the team, so there is little to plan.

你选择的框架都会在一定程度上支持你的辅导工作。Scrum 很方便的提供了一些预设的会议以及与团队的切入点，所以无需再多加计划。

Scrum also has two speciﬁc roles besides the development team, namely the ScrumMaster and the Product Owner. Both of these are make and break roles. As the agile coach, your job will become difﬁcult and you will lose precious time if one of the designated persons is unsuitable for the job or doesn’t have enough time to do it well.

Scrum 里除了开发团队还同时设定了两种特定的角色，Scrum Master 和 Product Owner。这两种都是可成事亦可败事的角色。如果其中一个特定的人不适合这项工作或者没有足够的时间把工作做好，作为敏捷教练你的工作将会变得异常困难并且会浪费掉很多宝贵的时间。

Kanban, on the other hand, doesn’t deﬁne any meetings or roles. We ﬁnd that many teams pick up meetings from other agile methods and these generally fall in one of three categories:

Kanban，另外一种框架，并没有定义任何的会议和角色。很多用Kanban框架的团队会从其他的敏捷方法里借鉴会议的形式，我们发现这些团队会使用以下三种类型的会议:

1. Just-in-time meetings: backlog replenishment, continuous improvement meetings, quality circles 
2. Asynchronous cadences: daily standups, backlog reﬁnement, retrospectives 
3. Cadences synchronized with other teams: daily standups, release demos

Just-in-time meetings are often scheduled on short notice — “hey, let’s reﬁne a couple of backlog items after lunch today” — which can be difﬁcult if you are working with multiple teams or multiple clients. Cadenced meetings on the other hand can be scheduled months in advance. For this reason, we have found it best to set up cadenced meetings during the coaching period also when working with Kanban teams.

1. 随机的会议：待办事项梳理会议，持续改进会议，质量控制圈
2. 与其他团队异步节奏的循环会议: 每日站会，待办事项梳理会议，回顾会议
3. 与其他团队同步节奏的循环会议：每日站会，发布会议，演示会议

随机的会议通常在开始前很短时间才通知:“嗨，我们午饭后梳理一下几个待办事项吧”， 要是跨团队或者有多个客户，这样的会议组织起来很困难.相比之下有节奏的会议可以提前数月就预订好。从这个角度出发，我们发现在辅导团队期间最好设置这样有节奏的会议，Kanban团队也一样。

Each of these touchpoints bring together the whole team or a subset of the team and provide a great opportunity for you to observe or interact with them. Don’t give them up too easily! New Scrum teams often think that some of the built-in activities are obsolete or boring and want to skip them. If that happens, we suggest that you ground the discussion with the team in the values and principles in the Agile Manifesto (“Agile Manifesto,” 2001). Together, ﬁgure out which values and which principles are behind each of the activities they want to skip. If the proposed change does not undermine those values and principles, just go for it. Otherwise a better option would be to ﬁgure out new and better ways to meet the values and principles.

跟团队或者一部分团队成员的每一次接触都给你提供了观察和交流的绝好机会。不要轻易放弃！新的Scrum团队容易觉得那些框架里的活动已经过时或者无聊而跳过。如果这样的事情发生，我们建议你与团队成员一起针对敏捷宣言里的价值观和原则进行探讨（“敏捷宣言”，2001年）。一起探讨一下，他们想跳过的是这项活动后面的哪一条价值观和哪一条准则。如果跳过这一步并不会破坏这些价值观或者原则，那就放手去做。但是如果破坏了，需要找出符合价值观和原则的新的更好的解决方案

When observing your team, it’s useful to look at team dynamics, what they talk about and the energy levels. We often use the following “cheat sheet” of questions, adapted from Lyssa Adkins (2010):

当观察你的团队的时候，观察团队的动态和他们在聊的内容以及团队的活跃程度会很有帮助。我们通常用下边这些‘小抄’问题（根据Lyssa Adkins的建议(2010年)做了一些改变）:

* Is everyone who wants to getting the time to speak? Are there dominant people in the room who need to listen more? Are there quiet voices that want to be heard? 
* 每个人都有机会发表自己的意见吗？房间里是否有人需要少说多听？是否有些声音被隐藏了？
* Are the ideas of high quality or are people simply going with the easiest solution? 
* 是否有人提出高质量的建议，还是他们只是走了捷径？
* Is the team moving toward the simplest solution possible? Or are they going future-proof and gold plating it too? 
* 团队正朝着最简易的解决方案迈进吗？还是他们只说不做夸夸其谈而已？
* Is the team getting tired? Do they need a break? 
* 团队是否疲倦？他们需要休息吗？
* Is the atmosphere getting tense? Do they need some comic relief? 
* 气氛是否紧张？是否需要开个玩笑缓解下气氛
* Is the team being audacious enough? Do they come up with great ideas or break through barriers? Or are they avoiding taking a risk
* 团队是否足够有勇气？他们是否拿得出好的想法并且勇往直前？还是他们并不想承担风险？
* Are they taking on as much as they could or are they letting “accepted” barriers get in the way
* 他们是否尽可能多的承担更多？还是得过且过？
* Is the team considering things in terms of customer value? Or in terms of their own effort? 
* 团队是否考虑顾客的利益？还是只考虑自己的得失？
* Are they stuck? Do they need a new perspective, one that brings them more possibilities?
* 他们被绊住了吗？是否需要一个新的视角，一个带来更多可能的视角？

This is intended to be a starter kit of observation points. Keep this list of observation questions handy, somewhere that you can quickly access it when a conversation justhappens around you. Overtime,youwillcome up with your own observation questions arising from what you observe. For example, if you work with several teams in the same company, you may notice that they behave similarly. Add your questions to this list and share them with fellow agile coaches.

这个是观察的入门套件。保留这些观察点，当类似的对话发生时你就可以得心应手的运用。随着时间的推移，你可以根据你所观察到的内容列出你自己的观察点。比如，如果你所在的公司有多个团队，你会发现他们有一些相似的行为。把这个观察点加入你的列表中，并且分享给另外的敏捷教练。
