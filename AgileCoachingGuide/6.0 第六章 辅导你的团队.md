辅导你的团队
---
By now we have covered what agile coaching is, talked about how to structure and facilitate coaching discussions with individuals and teams, discussed how groups of individuals can develop into teams, and how to form a new agile team. Next up, we will cover some of the better-known agile and lean frameworks and think about how they support agile coaching.

目前为止，我们覆盖到了敏捷教练的定义，讨论了怎样和个人以及团队一起组织辅导工作，讨论了怎样由多个单一个体成长为一个团队，以及怎样组建一个新的敏捷团队。接下来，我们将会展示一些知名的敏捷和精益框架，想想如何用这些框架支持敏捷辅导。

You will be coaching the team every time you meet them, but there are subtle differences in what to focus on in the different meetings and events. During backlog reﬁnement and sprint planning meetings, you should focus on facilitating — helping the team and stakeholders make great product decisions. After the daily standups, however, you have a great opportunity to grab ﬁve or ten minutes with the team following up on how they are doing short term. In the retrospectives, you can drive long term team questions.

你会抓住每一次见面的机会辅导你的团队，但是在不同的会议上你的侧重点会有细微的差别。在代办列表澄清会议和迭代计划会议上，你应该侧重于引导，即帮助团队和利益相关者针对产品做出更好的决策。在每天的站会后，你要抓住五到十分钟的机会和团队一起制定出短期的跟进方案。在回顾会议上，你可以驱动团队解决长期存在的问题。
